### Findings and Insights
1. The biggest Drop in retention rate typically occurs from Week 1 to Week 2. It is the most critical stage.				
2. Retention Rate progressively improved from Week 6 (2020-12-06) across all cohorts.				
3. 2020-12-20 had the best retention rate most likely due to the Festive season.				
4. The month of December had the best retention rate overall.				

### Recommendations
1. Throw out more promotions and offer discounts during festive periods - Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Thanksgiving.					
2. Most churn happens after the first week, strategies to ensure customer stay subscribed after the first week should be adopted.
